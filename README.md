Inserts GTM script in header for Enhanced Analytics.

Five different events are somewhat supported;

- Measuring Product Impressions
- Measuring Views of Product Details
- Measuring Product Clicks
- Measuring Additions or Removals from a Shopping Cart
- Measuring Purchases

Product Impressions are measured through an event that is available for the developer to add these to.

Product Clicks can be measured by firing a JS event. You need to edit the template to attach info that is needed for the event, such as sku and price.

Additions and Removals from Cart also need to be added by the developer.

Choose which events to measure - more info in the [Enhanced Ecommerce (UA) Developer Guide](https://developers.google.com/tag-manager/enhanced-ecommerce#enable).
